# 🛩️ Aircraft Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of aircraft engines based on time-series sensor data from the CMAPSS dataset.

It demonstrates how machine learning models can be used for **predictive maintenance** — helping prevent engine failure by forecasting when maintenance is needed.
